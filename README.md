An encryption script

## How it works ##

Every letter can be writed as ascii code. Ascii codes are simply universal letter codes that we can use for binary. (Machine language) AsCode wants an text input that you want to encrypt and the key that you will need later. Let's say that your text is "Hello, World!" the ascii code of this text is : 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33 now we can turn it to binary but everybody can use a binary to text website to decode that. So we add our key to every ascii code. Let's say our text is "Hello, World" and the key is "13" enter these to the "En-coder" app so the ascii codes becomed this : 85, 115, 121, 121, 124, 57, 45, 100, 124, 127, 121, 113, 46 now we can turn these ascii codes to binary and there you go!
01010101 01110011 01111001 01111001 01111100 00111001 00101101 01100100 01111100 01111111 01111001 01110001 00101110
If someone tries to turn these binary codes to text they will have this : "Usyy|9-d|yq."
If you want to decode these binary codes you will need the key. You just simply enter the encoded text and the key to the "De-coder" app and it will decode it.
